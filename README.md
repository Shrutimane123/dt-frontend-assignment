# DT Frontend Intern Assignment

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to convert a UI design into a functional webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Dynamic course cards generated from JavaScript objects
- Add new courses using form input
- Theme toggle using JavaScript
- Responsive layout using Flexbox

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Thought Process
I started by breaking the UI into components such as header, card section, and form.
I then created static HTML structure, followed by styling using CSS.
Finally, I implemented dynamic behavior using JavaScript objects, functions, and DOM manipulation.

## Learning Outcome
This project improved my understanding of JavaScript logic, event handling, and design-to-code workflow.
